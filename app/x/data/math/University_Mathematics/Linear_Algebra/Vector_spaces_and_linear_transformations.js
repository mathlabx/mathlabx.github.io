Vector spaces and linear transformations

Inputs:
- C_vector_spaces (boolean): Determines if questions related to vector spaces should be included.
- C_linear_transformations (boolean): Determines if questions about linear transformations should be included.
- C_basis_and_dimension (boolean): Determines if questions about basis and dimension of vector spaces should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to vector spaces and linear transformations. It covers topics such as determining if a set of vectors forms a vector space, properties of vector spaces, properties of linear transformations, and the basis and dimension of vector spaces. The questions may involve matrix representations, transformations, and various properties associated with vector spaces.

Example Usage:
const result = VectorSpacesAndLinearTransformations(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Determine if the set of vectors forms a vector space: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]', 'The set of vectors forms a vector space.']
*/

function VectorSpacesAndLinearTransformations(C_vector_spaces, C_linear_transformations, C_basis_and_dimension) {
    // Your code goes here

    // Return the question and answer in an array
    return [question, answer];
}
