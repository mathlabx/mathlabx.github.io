Equilibrium Constants for Chemical Reactions

Description:
This function generates questions related to equilibrium constants for chemical reactions, covering the calculation and interpretation of equilibrium constants, as well as numerical calculations associated with chemical reaction conditions. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- calculation (boolean): Determines if questions related to the calculation of equilibrium constants should be included.
- interpretation (boolean): Determines if questions related to the interpretation of equilibrium constants should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = EquilibriumConstantsForChemicalReactions(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Calculate the equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction.', 'The equilibrium constant (Kc) for the reaction is 3.42.']
