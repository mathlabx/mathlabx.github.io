/*
Metal and Non-Metal Elements

Description:
This function generates questions related to the properties and characteristics of metal and non-metal elements, covering the basic concepts of chemical elements, their properties, and behaviors.

Inputs:
- metalProperties (boolean): Determines if questions related to metal properties should be included.
- nonMetalProperties (boolean): Determines if questions related to non-metal properties should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = MetalAndNonMetalElements(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What are the distinguishing properties of metals?', 'The distinguishing properties of metals include ...']
