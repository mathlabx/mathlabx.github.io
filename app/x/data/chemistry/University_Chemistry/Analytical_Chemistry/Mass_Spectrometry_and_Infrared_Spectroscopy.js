Mass Spectrometry and Infrared Spectroscopy

Description:
This function generates questions related to mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy, covering the principles, techniques, and applications of these analytical methods in organic and inorganic analysis.

Inputs:
- massSpectrometry (boolean): Determines if questions related to mass spectrometry should be included.
- infraredSpectroscopy (boolean): Determines if questions related to infrared spectroscopy should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = MassSpectrometryAndInfraredSpectroscopy(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the principle behind mass spectrometry?', 'The principle behind mass spectrometry involves...']
