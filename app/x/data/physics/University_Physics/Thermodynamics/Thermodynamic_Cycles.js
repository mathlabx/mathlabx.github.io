Thermodynamic Cycles

Description:
This function generates questions related to thermodynamic cycles, covering various cycles such as the Carnot cycle, the Stirling cycle, and the Brayton cycle. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- carnotCycle (boolean): Determines if questions related to the Carnot cycle should be included.
- stirlingCycle (boolean): Determines if questions related to the Stirling cycle should be included.
- braytonCycle (boolean): Determines if questions related to the Brayton cycle should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = ThermodynamicCycles(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['In a Brayton cycle, the gas turbine has an inlet temperature of 800 K and an outlet temperature of 600 K. What is the thermal efficiency of the cycle?', 'The thermal efficiency of the Brayton cycle is 25%.']
