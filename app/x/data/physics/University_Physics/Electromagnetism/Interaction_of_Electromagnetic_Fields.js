Interaction of Electromagnetic Fields

Description:
This function generates questions related to the interaction of electromagnetic fields, covering various aspects such as the interaction between electric and magnetic fields, Lorentz force, etc. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- fieldInteraction (boolean): Determines if questions related to the interaction between electric and magnetic fields should be included.
- lorentzForce (boolean): Determines if questions related to the Lorentz force should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = InteractionOfElectromagneticFields(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['An electron moves with a velocity of 2 m/s in a magnetic field of 3 T. What is the magnetic force experienced by the electron?', 'The magnetic force experienced by the electron is 6 x 10^-19 N.']
