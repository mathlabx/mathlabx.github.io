Combinatorics

Inputs:
- counting_principles (boolean): Determines if questions related to basic counting principles should be included.
- permutations_combinations (boolean): Determines if questions related to permutations and combinations should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to combinatorial mathematics, including various counting principles, permutations, and combinations. It covers topics such as factorial notation, binomial coefficients, and the application of combinatorial concepts in probability and algebra.

Example Usage:
const result = Combinatorics(true, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['How many ways can 5 books be arranged on a shelf...', 'The number of ways to arrange 5 books on a shelf is...']
*/

$X.University_Mathematics.Discrete_Mathematics.Combinatorics = function(counting_principles, permutations_combinations) {
    // Your code goes here

    // Return the question and answer in an array
    return [question, answer];
}
