Methods of Chemical Analysis

Description:
This function generates questions related to methods of chemical analysis, covering the basic concepts of chemical analysis and the principles and applications of various analytical techniques.

Inputs:
- basicConcepts (boolean): Determines if questions related to basic concepts of chemical analysis should be included.
- analyticalTechniques (boolean): Determines if questions related to analytical techniques should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = MethodsOfChemicalAnalysis(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What are the key steps in a titration process?', 'The key steps in a titration process include...']
