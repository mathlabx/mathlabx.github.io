Reaction Mechanisms in Organic Chemistry

Description:
This function generates questions related to reaction mechanisms in organic chemistry, covering the basic concepts of different types of reactions and reaction steps.

Inputs:
- reactionTypes (boolean): Determines if questions related to different types of reactions should be included.
- reactionSteps (boolean): Determines if questions related to reaction steps should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = ReactionMechanismsInOrganicChemistry(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the type of the given organic reaction?', 'The type of the given organic reaction is ...']
