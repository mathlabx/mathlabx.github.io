Basic Concepts of Chemical Reactions

Description:
This function generates questions related to the basic concepts of chemical reactions, covering reaction types, chemical equations, and basic reaction conditions. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- reactionTypes (boolean): Determines if questions related to reaction types should be included.
- chemicalEquations (boolean): Determines if questions related to chemical equations should be included.
- reactionConditions (boolean): Determines if questions related to reaction conditions should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = BasicConceptsOfChemicalReactions(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What are the basic conditions necessary for a combustion reaction?', 'The basic conditions necessary for a combustion reaction include the presence of oxygen and a sufficient amount of energy to initiate the reaction.']
