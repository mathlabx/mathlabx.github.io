Electronic Band Theory

Description:
This function generates questions related to electronic band theory, covering various aspects such as band structure, conduction band, valence band, etc. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- bandStructure (boolean): Determines if questions related to band structure should be included.
- conductionBand (boolean): Determines if questions related to the conduction band should be included.
- valenceBand (boolean): Determines if questions related to the valence band should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = ElectronicBandTheory(true, true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the definition of the conduction band?', 'The conduction band is the energy band in a solid that is partially filled with electrons, allowing them to move and conduct electric current.']
