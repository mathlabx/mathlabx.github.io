Solving trigonometric equations

Inputs:
- C_linear (boolean): Determines if linear equations should be included.
- C_quadratic (boolean): Determines if quadratic equations should be included.
- C_exponential (boolean): Determines if exponential equations should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to solving trigonometric equations based on the specified input values. It can include linear equations, quadratic equations, and exponential equations involving trigonometric functions. The questions are designed to assess the user's ability to apply various methods to solve these equations. The answers are provided in a clear and concise manner to help users verify their solutions.

Example Usage:
const result = SolvingTrigonometricEquations(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Find the value of x satisfying the equation sin(x) = 0.5 in the interval [0, 2π].', 'x is equal to π/6 or 5π/6.']
