Wave Particle Duality

Description:
This function generates questions related to wave-particle duality, covering various aspects such as wavelength, frequency, energy, etc. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- wavelength (boolean): Determines if questions related to the wavelength should be included.
- frequency (boolean): Determines if questions related to the frequency should be included.
- energy (boolean): Determines if questions related to the energy should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = WaveParticleDuality(true, true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['An electron has a wavelength of 2 nm. What is its frequency?', 'The frequency of the electron is 1.5 x 10^17 Hz.']
