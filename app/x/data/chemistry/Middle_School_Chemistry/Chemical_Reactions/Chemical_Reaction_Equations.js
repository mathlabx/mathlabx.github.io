Chemical Reaction Equations

Description:
This function generates questions related to chemical reaction equations, covering the balancing of equations, reaction types, and characteristics. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- balancingEquations (boolean): Determines if questions related to balancing chemical equations should be included.
- reactionTypes (boolean): Determines if questions related to reaction types should be included.
- characteristics (boolean): Determines if questions related to reaction characteristics should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = ChemicalReactionEquations(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Balance the following chemical equation: H2 + O2 -> H2O', 'The balanced chemical equation is 2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O']
