/*
Properties of Matter

Description:
This function generates questions related to the properties of matter, covering various aspects such as density, solubility, conductivity, etc. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- density (boolean): Determines if questions related to density should be included.
- solubility (boolean): Determines if questions related to solubility should be included.
- conductivity (boolean): Determines if questions related to conductivity should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = PropertiesOfMatter(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the definition of conductivity?', 'Conductivity is the ability of a material to conduct an electric current.']
