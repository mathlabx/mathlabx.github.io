Kinematics

Inputs:
- velocity (boolean): Determines if questions related to velocity should be included.
- acceleration (boolean): Determines if questions related to acceleration should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the basic concepts of kinematics, covering topics such as velocity, acceleration, and their various properties. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Example Usage:
const result = Kinematics(true, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['A car accelerates uniformly from 20 m/s to 50 m/s in 4 seconds. What is the acceleration of the car?', 'The acceleration of the car is 7.5 m/s^2.']
*/

function Kinematics(velocity, acceleration) {
    var question = "";
    var answer = "";

    if (velocity) {
        // Logic for questions related to velocity
        // Generate questions and answers with randomly generated numerical values
        // ...
    }

    if (acceleration) {
        // Logic for questions related to acceleration
        // Generate questions and answers with randomly generated numerical values
        // ...
    }

    // Return the question and answer in an array
    return [question, answer];
}
