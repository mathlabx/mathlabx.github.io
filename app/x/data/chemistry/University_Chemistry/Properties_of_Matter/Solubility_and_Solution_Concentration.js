Solubility and Solution Concentration

Description:
This function generates questions related to solubility and solution concentration, covering topics such as the principles of solubility, concentration units, and their applications in various chemical processes and analyses.

Inputs:
- solubility (boolean): Determines if questions related to solubility should be included.
- solutionConcentration (boolean): Determines if questions related to solution concentration should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = SolubilityAndSolutionConcentration(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What factors affect the solubility of a substance?', 'The solubility of a substance is affected by...']
