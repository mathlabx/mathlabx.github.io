/*
Complex numbers and complex functions

Inputs:
- C_operations (boolean): Determines if questions related to basic operations with complex numbers should be included.
- C_roots (boolean): Determines if questions related to finding roots of complex numbers should be included.
- C_complex_functions (boolean): Determines if questions related to complex functions should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to complex numbers and complex functions. It covers topics such as basic operations with complex numbers, finding roots of complex numbers, and understanding various complex functions. The questions may involve finding conjugates, computing complex roots, and analyzing the behavior of complex functions.

Example Usage:
const result = ComplexNumbersAndFunctions(true, true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Perform the division of the complex numbers (3+4i) and (2-3i)...', 'The result of the division is ...']
*/

$X.University_Mathematics.Complex_Analysis.ComplexNumbersAndFunctions = function(C_operations, C_roots, C_complex_functions) {
    // Your code goes here

    // Return the question and answer in an array
    return [question, answer];
}
