Redox Reactions

Description:
This function generates questions related to redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions, covering topics such as the principles, identification, and applications of redox reactions in various chemical processes and systems.

Inputs:
- redoxPrinciples (boolean): Determines if questions related to the principles of redox reactions should be included.
- redoxIdentification (boolean): Determines if questions related to the identification of redox reactions should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = RedoxReactions(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What defines a redox reaction?', 'A redox reaction is defined as...']
