/*
Structure of Atomic Nuclei

Inputs:
- subatomicParticles (boolean): Determines if questions related to subatomic particles should be included.
- nuclearForces (boolean): Determines if questions related to nuclear forces should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the structure of atomic nuclei, covering topics such as subatomic particles and nuclear forces. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Example Usage:
const result = StructureOfAtomicNuclei(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What are the subatomic particles present in a nucleus?', 'The subatomic particles are protons and neutrons.']
*/

function StructureOfAtomicNuclei(subatomicParticles, nuclearForces) {
    var question = "";
    var answer = "";

    if (subatomicParticles) {
        // Logic for questions related to subatomic particles
        // Generate questions and answers with randomly generated numerical values
        // ...
    }

    if (nuclearForces) {
        // Logic for questions related to nuclear forces
        // Generate questions and answers with randomly generated numerical values
        // ...
    }

    // Return the question and answer in an array
    return [question, answer];
