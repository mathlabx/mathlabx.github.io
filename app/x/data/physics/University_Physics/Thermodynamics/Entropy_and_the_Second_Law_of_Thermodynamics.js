Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics

Description:
This function generates questions related to entropy and the second law of thermodynamics, covering various aspects such as changes in system entropy and the directionality of thermodynamic processes. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- systemEntropy (boolean): Determines if questions related to changes in system entropy should be included.
- processDirection (boolean): Determines if questions related to the directionality of thermodynamic processes should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = EntropyAndSecondLaw(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['During an irreversible process, the entropy of a system increases by 50 J/K. What is the heat absorbed by the system if the temperature remains constant?', 'The heat absorbed by the system is 50 J.']

        // Logic for questions related to the directionality of thermodynamic processes
        // Generate questions and answers with randomly generated numerical values
        // ...
