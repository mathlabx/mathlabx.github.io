Radioactive Decay Processes

Description:
This function generates questions related to radioactive decay processes, covering topics such as the principles, types, and applications of radioactive decay in various fields, including nuclear physics, medicine, and environmental science.

Inputs:
- decayPrinciples (boolean): Determines if questions related to the principles of radioactive decay should be included.
- decayTypes (boolean): Determines if questions related to the types of radioactive decay should be included.
- decayApplications (boolean): Determines if questions related to the applications of radioactive decay should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = RadioactiveDecayProcesses(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What are the main principles governing radioactive decay?', 'The main principles governing radioactive decay include...']
