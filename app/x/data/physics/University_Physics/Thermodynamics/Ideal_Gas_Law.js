Ideal Gas Law

Description:
This function generates questions related to the ideal gas law, covering topics such as pressure, volume, amount of substance, and temperature. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- pressure (boolean): Determines if questions related to pressure should be included.
- volume (boolean): Determines if questions related to volume should be included.
- moles (boolean): Determines if questions related to the amount of substance should be included.
- temperature (boolean): Determines if questions related to temperature should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = IdealGasLaw(true, true, true, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['A gas occupies a volume of 5.6 L at a pressure of 1.2 atm. What is the amount of substance if the temperature is 300 K?', 'The amount of substance is 0.24 mol.']
