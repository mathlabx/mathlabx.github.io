/*
Chemical Symbols and the Periodic Table

Description:
This function generates questions related to chemical symbols and the periodic table, covering the symbols of different chemical elements and their positions and properties in the periodic table. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- chemicalSymbols (boolean): Determines if questions related to chemical symbols should be included.
- periodicTable (boolean): Determines if questions related to the periodic table should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = ChemicalSymbolsAndThePeriodicTable(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the chemical symbol for Oxygen?', 'The chemical symbol for Oxygen is O.']
