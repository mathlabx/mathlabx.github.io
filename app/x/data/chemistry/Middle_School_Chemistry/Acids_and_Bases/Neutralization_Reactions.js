Neutralization Reactions

Description:
This function generates questions related to neutralization reactions, covering the basic concepts, reaction processes, and products of neutralization reactions. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- basicConcepts (boolean): Determines if questions related to the basic concepts of neutralization reactions should be included.
- reactionProcesses (boolean): Determines if questions related to the processes involved in neutralization reactions should be included.
- reactionProducts (boolean): Determines if questions related to the products of neutralization reactions should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = NeutralizationReactions(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What are the key concepts involved in neutralization reactions?', 'Neutralization reactions are chemical reactions between an acid and a base that produce a salt and water.']
