Maxwell Equations

Description:
This function generates questions related to Maxwell's equations, covering various aspects of the electromagnetic field, including electric fields, magnetic fields, and the relationships between electric charges and currents. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- electricField (boolean): Determines if questions related to electric fields should be included.
- magneticField (boolean): Determines if questions related to magnetic fields should be included.
- chargesAndCurrents (boolean): Determines if questions related to the relationships between charges and currents should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = MaxwellEquations(true, true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['An electric field in a vacuum has a magnitude of 50 N/C. What is the force experienced by a charge of 2 C?', 'The force experienced by the charge is 100 N.']
