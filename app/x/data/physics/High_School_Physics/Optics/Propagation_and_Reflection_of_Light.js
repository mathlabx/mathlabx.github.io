Propagation and Reflection of Light

Inputs:
- refraction (boolean): Determines if questions related to refraction of light should be included.
- totalInternalReflection (boolean): Determines if questions related to total internal reflection should be included.
- mirrors (boolean): Determines if questions related to mirrors should be included.
- lenses (boolean): Determines if questions related to lenses should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the propagation and reflection of light, including refraction, total internal reflection, mirrors, and lenses. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Example Usage:
const result = PropagationAndReflectionOfLight(true, false, true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['A concave mirror has a radius of curvature of 10 cm. What is its focal length?', 'The focal length of the mirror is 5 cm.']
