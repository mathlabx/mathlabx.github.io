Indefinite and definite integrals

Inputs:
- C_indefinite (boolean): Determines if questions about indefinite integrals should be included.
- C_definite (boolean): Determines if questions about definite integrals should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to both indefinite and definite integrals. It covers topics such as finding antiderivatives, evaluating definite integrals over specific intervals, and applying the fundamental theorem of calculus. The questions aim to test the user's understanding of these fundamental concepts in calculus and their practical applications in solving various mathematical problems.

Example Usage:
const result = IndefiniteAndDefiniteIntegrals(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Find the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5', 'The indefinite integral is F(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 5x + C.']
*/

function IndefiniteAndDefiniteIntegrals(C_indefinite, C_definite) {
    // Your code goes here

    // Return the question and answer in an array
    return [question, answer];
}
