Special Relativity and the Lorentz Transformation

Description:
This function generates questions related to special relativity and the Lorentz transformation, covering various aspects such as the basic concepts of special relativity, applications of the Lorentz transformation, etc. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- specialRelativityConcepts (boolean): Determines if questions related to the basic concepts of special relativity should be included.
- lorentzTransformationApplications (boolean): Determines if questions related to the applications of the Lorentz transformation should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = SpecialRelativityAndLorentzTransformation(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is time dilation in special relativity?', 'Time dilation is the phenomenon where time appears to pass more slowly in a moving reference frame relative to a stationary observer.']
