Thermochemical Equations

Description:
This function generates questions related to thermochemical equations, covering the basic concepts of enthalpy changes, heat reactions, and the balancing of thermochemical equations. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- enthalpyChanges (boolean): Determines if questions related to enthalpy changes should be included.
- heatReactions (boolean): Determines if questions related to heat reactions should be included.
- balancingEquations (boolean): Determines if questions related to balancing thermochemical equations should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = ThermochemicalEquations(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the balanced thermochemical equation for the given enthalpy change?', 'The balanced thermochemical equation for the given enthalpy change is CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O.']
