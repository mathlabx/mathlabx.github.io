Mass Energy Equivalence

Description:
This function generates questions related to mass-energy equivalence, covering various aspects such as the concept of mass-energy conversion, applications of mass-energy conversion, etc. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- massEnergyConversionConcepts (boolean): Determines if questions related to the concept of mass-energy conversion should be included.
- massEnergyConversionApplications (boolean): Determines if questions related to the applications of mass-energy conversion should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = MassEnergyEquivalence(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What does E=mc^2 signify?', 'E=mc^2 signifies the mass-energy equivalence, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light.']
