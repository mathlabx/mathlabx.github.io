/*
Crystal Structures and Lattice Vibrations

Description:
This function generates questions related to crystal structures and lattice vibrations, covering various aspects such as the concept of crystal structures, principles of lattice vibrations, etc. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- crystalStructureConcepts (boolean): Determines if questions related to the concept of crystal structures should be included.
- latticeVibrationsPrinciples (boolean): Determines if questions related to the principles of lattice vibrations should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = CrystalStructuresAndLatticeVibrations(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is a unit cell in crystallography?', 'A unit cell is the smallest repeating unit in a crystal lattice.']
