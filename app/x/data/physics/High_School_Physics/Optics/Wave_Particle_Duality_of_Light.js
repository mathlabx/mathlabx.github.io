Wave Particle Duality of Light

Inputs:
- wavelength (boolean): Determines if questions related to wavelength should be included.
- frequency (boolean): Determines if questions related to frequency should be included.
- energy (boolean): Determines if questions related to energy should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the wave-particle duality of light, including topics such as wavelength, frequency, and energy. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Example Usage:
const result = WaveParticleDualityOfLight(true, true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the frequency of a light wave with a wavelength of 500 nm?', 'The frequency of the light wave is 6.0 * 10^14 Hz.']

    if (frequency) {
        // Logic for questions related to frequency
        // Generate questions and answers with randomly generated numerical values
        // ...
