Trigonometric identities

Inputs:
- C_pythagorean (boolean): Determines if Pythagorean identities should be included.
- C_quotient (boolean): Determines if quotient identities should be included.
- C_reciprocal (boolean): Determines if reciprocal identities should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to various trigonometric identities based on the specified input values. It can include Pythagorean identities, quotient identities, and reciprocal identities based on the user's selection. The questions are designed to test the user's understanding and application of these identities in various contexts. The answers are provided in a clear and concise manner to help users verify their solutions.

Example Usage:
const result = TrigonometricIdentities(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Given sin(theta) = 0.6, find cos(theta) using the reciprocal identity.', 'cos(theta) is equal to 0.8.']
*/

function TrigonometricIdentities(C_pythagorean, C_quotient, C_reciprocal) {
    // Your code goes here

    // Return the question and answer in an array
    return [question, answer];
}
