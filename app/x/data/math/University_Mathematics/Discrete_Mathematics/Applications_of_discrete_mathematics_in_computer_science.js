Applications of Discrete Mathematics in Computer Science

Inputs:
- graph_theory (boolean): Determines if questions related to graph theory and its applications should be included.
- logic_circuits (boolean): Determines if questions related to logic circuits and Boolean algebra should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the application of discrete mathematics in computer science. It covers topics such as graph theory, Boolean algebra, logic circuits, and their practical applications in designing algorithms and data structures in computer systems.

Example Usage:
const result = Applications_Discrete_Math_CS(true, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['In a graph G with 5 vertices...', 'The number of edges in the graph G is...']
*/

$X.University_Mathematics.Discrete_Mathematics.Applications_Discrete_Math_CS = function(graph_theory, logic_circuits) {
    // Your code goes here

    // Return the question and answer in an array
    return [question, answer];
}
