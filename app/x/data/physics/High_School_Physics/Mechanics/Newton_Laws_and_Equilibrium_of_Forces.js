/*
Newton Laws and Equilibrium of Forces

Inputs:
- firstLaw (boolean): Determines if questions related to the first law of Newton should be included.
- secondLaw (boolean): Determines if questions related to the second law of Newton should be included.
- thirdLaw (boolean): Determines if questions related to the third law of Newton should be included.
- equilibrium (boolean): Determines if questions related to the equilibrium of forces should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to the Newton's laws of motion and equilibrium of forces, covering topics such as the first, second, and third laws of motion and the principles of equilibrium. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Example Usage:
const result = NewtonLawsAndEquilibrium(true, true, false, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['A force of 10 N acts on a body of mass 2 kg. What is the acceleration of the body according to the second law of Newton?', 'The acceleration of the body is 5 m/s^2.']

    var question = "";
    var answer = "";

    if (firstLaw) {
        // Logic for questions related to the first law of Newton
        // Generate questions and answers with randomly generated numerical values
        // ...

    if (secondLaw) {
        // Logic for questions related to the second law of Newton
        // Generate questions and answers with randomly generated numerical values
        // ...
    }

    if (thirdLaw) {
        // Logic for questions related to the third law of Newton
        // Generate questions and answers with randomly generated numerical values
        // ...

        // Logic for questions related to the equilibrium of forces
        // Generate questions and answers with randomly generated numerical values
        // ...
    }

    // Return the question and answer in an array
    return [question, answer];
