Nuclear Reactions and Nuclear Energy

Description:
This function generates questions related to nuclear reactions and nuclear energy, covering topics such as the principles, types, and applications of nuclear reactions in various fields, including nuclear physics, energy production, and environmental science.

Inputs:
- reactionPrinciples (boolean): Determines if questions related to the principles of nuclear reactions should be included.
- reactionTypes (boolean): Determines if questions related to the types of nuclear reactions should be included.
- energyApplications (boolean): Determines if questions related to the applications of nuclear energy should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = NuclearReactionsAndNuclearEnergy(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What are the fundamental principles underlying nuclear reactions?', 'The fundamental principles underlying nuclear reactions include...']
