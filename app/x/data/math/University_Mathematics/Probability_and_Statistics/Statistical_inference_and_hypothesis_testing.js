Statistical inference and hypothesis testing

Inputs:
- C_sampling (boolean): Determines if questions related to sampling methods and techniques should be included.
- C_confidence_intervals (boolean): Determines if questions related to constructing confidence intervals should be included.
- C_hypothesis_testing (boolean): Determines if questions related to hypothesis testing should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to statistical inference and hypothesis testing. It covers topics such as various sampling methods, constructing confidence intervals, and conducting hypothesis tests for different types of statistical analyses. The questions may involve calculating p-values, conducting t-tests, and interpreting confidence intervals.

Example Usage:
const result = StatisticalInferenceAndHypothesisTesting(true, true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean weight of the population given the sample mean... ', 'The 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight is ... ']
*/

$X.math.University_Mathematics.Probability_and_Statistics.StatisticalInferenceAndHypothesisTesting = function (C_sampling, C_confidence_intervals, C_hypothesis_testing) {
    // Your code goes here

    // Return the question and answer in an array
    return [question, answer];
}
