/*
Coordination Chemistry and Transition Metal Compounds

Description:
This function generates questions related to coordination chemistry and transition metal compounds, covering the basic concepts of coordination compounds and the properties of transition metal compounds.

Inputs:
- coordinationConcepts (boolean): Determines if questions related to coordination concepts should be included.
- transitionMetalProperties (boolean): Determines if questions related to transition metal properties should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = CoordinationChemistryAndTransitionMetalCompounds(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the role of ligands in coordination chemistry?', 'The role of ligands in coordination chemistry is ...']
