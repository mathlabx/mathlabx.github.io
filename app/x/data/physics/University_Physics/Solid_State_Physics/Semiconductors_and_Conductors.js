/*
Semiconductors and Conductors

Description:
This function generates questions related to semiconductors and conductors, covering various aspects such as their properties, applications, etc. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Inputs:
- semiconductorProperties (boolean): Determines if questions related to semiconductor properties should be included.
- conductorApplications (boolean): Determines if questions related to conductor applications should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Example Usage:
const result = SemiconductorsAndConductors(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the definition of a semiconductor?', 'A semiconductor is a material whose conductivity is between that of a conductor and an insulator under the influence of an electric field or magnetic field.']
