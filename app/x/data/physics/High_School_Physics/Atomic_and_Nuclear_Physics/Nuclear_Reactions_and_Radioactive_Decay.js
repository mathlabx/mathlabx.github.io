/*
Nuclear Reactions and Radioactive Decay

Inputs:
- nuclearReactions (boolean): Determines if questions related to nuclear reactions should be included.
- radioactiveDecay (boolean): Determines if questions related to radioactive decay should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to nuclear reactions and radioactive decay, covering topics such as nuclear reactions and types of radioactive decay. All numerical values are randomly generated.

Example Usage:
const result = NuclearReactionsAndRadioactiveDecay(true, false);
console.log(result); // Output: ['What is the product of the nuclear reaction 4He + 9Be?', 'The product is 12C.']

function NuclearReactionsAndRadioactiveDecay(nuclearReactions, radioactiveDecay) {
    var question = "";
    var answer = "";

    if (nuclearReactions) {
        // Logic for questions related to nuclear reactions
        // Generate questions and answers with randomly generated numerical values
        // ...
    }

    if (radioactiveDecay) {
        // Logic for questions related to radioactive decay
        // Generate questions and answers with randomly generated numerical values
        // ...
    }

    // Return the question and answer in an array
    return [question, answer];
