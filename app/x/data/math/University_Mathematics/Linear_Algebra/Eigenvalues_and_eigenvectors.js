Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

Inputs:
- C_eigenvalues (boolean): Determines if questions related to eigenvalues should be included.
- C_eigenvectors (boolean): Determines if questions related to eigenvectors should be included.
- C_eigenbases (boolean): Determines if questions about eigenbases should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It covers topics such as finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices, properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and the concept of an eigenbasis. The questions may involve computations, properties, and applications of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Example Usage:
const result = EigenvaluesAndEigenvectors(true, false, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Find the eigenvalues of the matrix [[3, 1], [2, 4]]', 'The eigenvalues are 2 and 5.']
*/

$X.math.University_Mathematics.Linear_Algebra.EigenvaluesAndEigenvectors = function(C_eigenvalues, C_eigenvectors, C_eigenbases) {
    // Your code goes here

    // Return the question and answer in an array
    return [question, answer];
}
