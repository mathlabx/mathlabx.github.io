Analytic functions and conformal mappings

Inputs:
- A_functions (boolean): Determines if questions related to properties of analytic functions should be included.
- A_mappings (boolean): Determines if questions related to conformal mappings should be included.

Outputs:
- Array: An array containing the question and answer generated based on the provided inputs.

Description:
This function generates questions related to analytic functions and conformal mappings. It covers topics such as the properties of analytic functions and the behavior of conformal mappings. The questions may involve understanding the concepts of complex differentiability, mapping properties, and the preservation of angles.

Example Usage:
const result = AnalyticFunctionsAndMappings(true, true);
console.log(result); // Output: ['Explain the concept of complex differentiability...', 'The concept of complex differentiability refers to...']
*/

$X.University_Mathematics.Complex_Analysis.AnalyticFunctionsAndMappings = function(A_functions, A_mappings) {
    // Your code goes here

    // Return the question and answer in an array
    return [question, answer];
}
